# M2T1 - Webapp #1 

## goals: 
- to learn basic flask programming
- to be able to repeat a server config
- maybe to have fun

## lessons learned 
bash commands you cannot live without:
- ls <- what's in this directory
- cd <- change directory
- source <- run a script (like activate)

install library:

 - first set up virutalenvironment
 - pip install virtualenv
 - virtualenv venv
 - source veenv/bin/activate
 now we have our "venv" environment, so we can install things in it
 to turn it off: 
 - deactivate

 start installing requirements:
 - pip install flask
 - pip freeze > requirements.txt
